 It suffers not in smiling pomp, nor falls  
 Under the brow of thralling discontent;  
 It fears not policy, that heretic,  
 That works on leases of short numbered hours,  
 But all alone stands hugely politic.</code></pre><p>In the strength of his constancy, the Pyramids seem to him recent and transitory. The freshness of youth and love dazzles him with its resemblance to morning.</p><pre><code>      Take those lips away  
 Which so sweetly were forsworn;  
 And those eyes,ï¿½the break of day,  
 Lights that do mislead the morn.</code></pre><p>The wild beauty of this hyperbole, I may say, in passing, it would not be easy to match in literature.</p></div> </div>
