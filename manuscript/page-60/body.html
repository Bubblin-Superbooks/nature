<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">Hand of the mind;�to instruct us that "good thoughts are no better than good dreams, unless they be executed!"</p><p>The same good office is performed by Property and its filial systems of debt and credit. Debt, grinding debt, whose iron face the widow, the orphan, and the sons of genius fear and hate;�debt, which consumes so much time, which so cripples and disheartens a great spirit with cares that seem so base, is a preceptor whose lessons cannot be forgone, and is needed most by those who suffer from it most. Moreover, property, which has been well compared to snow,�"if it fall level to-day, it will be blown into drifts to-morrow,"�is the surface action of internal machinery, like the index on the face of a clock. Whilst now it is the gymnastics of the understanding, it is hiving in the foresight of the spirit, experience in profounder laws.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">The whole character and fortune of the individual</p></div> </div>
