     "Nothing hath got so far  
But man hath caught and kept it as his prey;  
     His eyes dismount the highest star;  
He is in little all the sphere.  
     Herbs gladly cure our flesh, because that they  
Find their acquaintance there.

     "For us, the winds do blow,  
The earth doth rest, heaven move, and fountains flow;  
     Nothing we see, but means our good,  
As our delight, or as our treasure;  
     The whole is either our cupboard of food,  
Or cabinet of pleasure.

     "The stars have us to bed:  
Night draws the curtain; which the sun withdraws.
